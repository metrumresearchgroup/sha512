sha512
=====
A password hashing library.

The goal of sha512 is to isolate a flapping dependency and focus it on the only
functionality we needed.

The test suite was copied directly over from the origin, and only the package
structure has been changed to flatten it.

Note: forked from <https://github.com/tredoe/osutil>
